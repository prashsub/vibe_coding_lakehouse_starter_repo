# Verification Metadata Template
# Copy these fields into any SKILL.md frontmatter to enable freshness auditing.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Add these fields to your skill's metadata section
#   2. Set volatility based on how often the underlying APIs change
#   3. Add verification_sources for skills with external documentation links
#   4. Update last_verified each time the skill is verified against docs

# --- Add to frontmatter metadata section ---

metadata:
  # ISO date when skill was last verified against official documentation
  # Update this even if no changes were needed after verification
  last_verified: "2026-02-07"

  # How often the underlying APIs/patterns change
  # high   = APIs change frequently (GenAI, MLflow 3.x, Genie APIs) → stale after 30 days
  # medium = Features evolve but core stable (DLT, monitoring, DABs) → stale after 90 days
  # low    = Stable patterns, rarely change (ERDs, naming, merge)    → stale after 180 days
  volatility: medium

  # URLs to verify skill content against (optional but recommended)
  # Only include for skills that reference specific external documentation
  verification_sources:
    - url: "https://docs.databricks.com/path/to/relevant/page"
      check_for: "Brief description of what to verify (e.g., API signature, YAML syntax)"
    - url: "https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/path/to/page"
      check_for: "Brief description of what to verify"

# Upstream source lineage tracking (tracks repo-level dependencies)
  # Links this skill back to its source(s) in databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit or other repos.
  # This complements verification_sources (which checks live doc URLs) by tracking structured
  # repo-level lineage for systematic upstream sync audits.
  upstream_sources:
    - name: "ai-dev-kit"
      repo: "databricks-solutions/ai-dev-kit"
      paths:
        - "databricks-skills/agent-bricks/SKILL.md"       # specific file(s) this skill derives from
      relationship: "extended"    # derived | extended | inspired | reference
      last_synced: "2026-02-09"   # ISO date when skill was last synced with upstream
      sync_commit: "abc1234"      # short hash of upstream commit at time of last sync

  # Relationship types:
  #   derived  — skill content directly draws from upstream source
  #   extended — skill extends upstream with significant additional patterns
  #   inspired — upstream was conceptual starting point, heavily customized
  #   reference — skill references upstream for accuracy, content is original

  # For skills with NO upstream dependency, use an empty array:
  # upstream_sources: []  # Internal methodology, no upstream dependency
