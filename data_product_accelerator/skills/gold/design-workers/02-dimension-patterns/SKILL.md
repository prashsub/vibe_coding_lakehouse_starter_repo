# Dimension Design Patterns

## Overview

Beyond basic dimension tables, real-world dimensional models require specialized patterns to handle time-variant roles, degenerate keys, low-cardinality flags, deep hierarchies, and NULL values. Choosing the wrong pattern leads to query complexity, redundant joins, or data quality issues that surface late in development.

**Key Principle:** Denormalize aggressively within dimensions. Each dimension row should carry all the context a query needs without requiring additional joins.

**Companion skill:** For SCD Type 1/2 documentation standards (surrogate keys, effective dates, is_current flags), see `design-workers/06-table-documentation/SKILL.md`.

## When to Use This Skill

- Designing dimension tables that play multiple roles (e.g., order_date vs ship_date)
- Deciding whether to create a junk dimension for low-cardinality flags
- Handling NULL foreign keys or missing dimension attributes
- Flattening hierarchies (org charts, product categories, geographies)
- Choosing between outrigger dimensions vs denormalization

## Dimension Pattern Quick Reference

| Pattern | Use When | Key Rule |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Role-Playing** | Same dimension used in multiple FK roles | Create views, not copies |
| **Degenerate** | Dimension has no attributes beyond the key | Store as fact table column, no dim table |
| **Junk** | Multiple low-cardinality flags/indicators | Combine into one dimension |
| **Mini-Dimension** | Rapidly changing subset of a large dimension | Split volatile attributes into separate dim |
| **Outrigger** | Dimension references another dimension | FK from dim to dim (use sparingly) |
| **Denormalized Hierarchy** | Multi-level hierarchy (org, geography) | Flatten all levels into one row |
| **Multiple Hierarchies** | Same dimension has alternate rollup paths | Add columns for each hierarchy path |

## Critical Rules

### 1. Denormalize, Do Not Snowflake

**NEVER** normalize dimension tables into sub-tables (snowflaking). Every join a BI tool must traverse degrades query performance and confuses business users.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Snowflaked (separate tables for each hierarchy level)
# dim_product → dim_subcategory → dim_category → dim_department

# ✅ GOOD: Denormalized flat dimension
table_name: dim_product
columns:
  - name: product_key
    type: BIGINT
    nullable: false
  - name: product_name
    type: STRING
  - name: subcategory_name    # Flattened from subcategory table
    type: STRING
  - name: category_name       # Flattened from category table
    type: STRING
  - name: department_name     # Flattened from department table
    type: STRING
```

### 2. Replace NULLs with Descriptive Values

Dimension foreign keys should **never** be NULL. Instead, point to a dedicated "Unknown" or "Not Applicable" row in the dimension table.

```yaml
# ✅ GOOD: Unknown member row in dimension
# dim_customer row: customer_key = -1, customer_name = "Unknown", ...
# fact_orders: customer_key = -1 (instead of NULL)
```

**Why:** NULLs break GROUP BY aggregations, confuse BI tools, and make outer joins necessary. An "Unknown" row participates cleanly in all queries.

### 3. Flags Must Be Textual Attributes

Never store boolean flags as `true`/`false` or `0`/`1` in dimensions. Use full textual descriptions.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Boolean flags
- name: is_active
  type: BOOLEAN

# ✅ GOOD: Textual attributes
- name: active_status
  type: STRING
  description: "Active status indicator. Business: Shows whether entity is currently active. Technical: Values are 'Active' or 'Inactive'."
```

**Why:** BI reports display raw values. "Active" reads better than "true" in dashboards and Genie responses.

### 4. Avoid Abstract Generic Dimensions

Never create catch-all "entity" or "type" dimensions that combine unrelated business concepts.

```yaml
# ❌ BAD: Generic dimension combining unrelated concepts
table_name: dim_entity  # Contains customers, products, stores...

# ✅ GOOD: Separate dimensions per business concept
table_name: dim_customer
table_name: dim_product
table_name: dim_store
```

## Pattern Details

### Role-Playing Dimensions

When the same dimension (e.g., `dim_date`) appears in multiple foreign key roles on a fact table:

```yaml
# Fact table references dim_date three times
table_name: fact_orders
columns:
  - name: order_date_key
    type: BIGINT
    description: "Order placement date. Business: When the order was placed. Technical: FK to dim_date."
    foreign_key:
      references: dim_date.date_key
  - name: ship_date_key
    type: BIGINT
    description: "Shipment date. Business: When the order shipped. Technical: FK to dim_date."
    foreign_key:
      references: dim_date.date_key
  - name: delivery_date_key
    type: BIGINT
    description: "Delivery date. Business: When customer received order. Technical: FK to dim_date."
    foreign_key:
      references: dim_date.date_key
```

**Implementation:** Create SQL views (`dim_order_date`, `dim_ship_date`, `dim_delivery_date`) over the single physical `dim_date` table. Do NOT create separate physical tables.

### Degenerate Dimensions

When a dimension key has no meaningful attributes beyond the key itself (e.g., order number, invoice number):

```yaml
# ✅ Store directly on the fact table — no separate dimension table
table_name: fact_order_lines
columns:
  - name: order_number
    type: STRING
    description: "Order number. Business: Groups line items belonging to same order. Technical: Degenerate dimension — no separate dim table."
```

**Rule:** If the only attribute is the key itself, it belongs on the fact table as a degenerate dimension.

### Junk Dimensions

When a fact table has multiple low-cardinality flags (2-5 possible values each), combine them into a single junk dimension instead of cluttering the fact table.

```yaml
table_name: dim_order_flags
description: "Order flag combinations. Business: Categorizes orders by processing characteristics. Technical: Junk dimension combining low-cardinality indicators."
columns:
  - name: order_flag_key
    type: BIGINT
    nullable: false
  - name: payment_method
    type: STRING    # "Credit Card", "Debit Card", "Cash", "Gift Card"
  - name: shipping_priority
    type: STRING    # "Standard", "Express", "Overnight"
  - name: gift_wrap_status
    type: STRING    # "Gift Wrapped", "Not Gift Wrapped"
  - name: return_eligibility
    type: STRING    # "Returnable", "Final Sale"
```

**Threshold:** Create a junk dimension when you have 3+ flags with combined cardinality under ~50 combinations.

## Validation Checklist (Design Phase)

Before finalizing any dimension YAML schema:

- [ ] No snowflaked sub-tables — all hierarchies flattened into dimension
- [ ] NULL handling defined — "Unknown" row planned for each dimension
- [ ] All flags are textual (STRING), not BOOLEAN
- [ ] Role-playing dimensions use views, not physical copies
- [ ] Degenerate dimensions stored on fact table, no empty dim tables
- [ ] Junk dimension considered for 3+ low-cardinality flags
- [ ] No abstract generic dimensions combining unrelated concepts

## Reference Files

- **[Dimension Pattern Catalog](references/dimension-pattern-catalog.md)** — Extended examples for mini-dimensions, outrigger dimensions, multiple hierarchies, and bridge tables with YAML templates

## Inputs

- **From `01-grain-definition`:** Fact table grain definitions and PK structure (reveals which dimensions are needed as FK targets)
- **From orchestrator Phase 0/1:** Source schema inventory with table classifications (dimension/fact/bridge)

## Outputs

- Dimension table YAML schemas with pattern annotations (role-playing, degenerate, junk, etc.)
- NULL handling strategy document (which dimensions get "Unknown" rows)
- Hierarchy flattening decisions (which levels to denormalize)

## Design Notes to Carry Forward

After completing this skill, note:
- [ ] Which dimensions are role-playing (need views during implementation)
- [ ] Which dimensions have "Unknown" member rows planned
- [ ] Which flags were combined into junk dimensions (and the junk dimension name)
- [ ] Any mini-dimension splits (volatile attributes separated from main dimension)

## Next Step

Proceed to `design-workers/03-fact-table-patterns/SKILL.md` to apply advanced fact table patterns (measure additivity, factless facts, accumulating snapshots).
