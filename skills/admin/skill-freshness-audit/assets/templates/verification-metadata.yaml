# Verification Metadata Template
# Copy these fields into any SKILL.md frontmatter to enable freshness auditing.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Add these fields to your skill's metadata section
#   2. Set volatility based on how often the underlying APIs change
#   3. Add verification_sources for skills with external documentation links
#   4. Update last_verified each time the skill is verified against docs

# --- Add to frontmatter metadata section ---

metadata:
  # ISO date when skill was last verified against official documentation
  # Update this even if no changes were needed after verification
  last_verified: "2026-02-07"

  # How often the underlying APIs/patterns change
  # high   = APIs change frequently (GenAI, MLflow 3.x, Genie APIs) → stale after 30 days
  # medium = Features evolve but core stable (DLT, monitoring, DABs) → stale after 90 days
  # low    = Stable patterns, rarely change (ERDs, naming, merge)    → stale after 180 days
  volatility: medium

  # URLs to verify skill content against (optional but recommended)
  # Only include for skills that reference specific external documentation
  verification_sources:
    - url: "https://docs.databricks.com/path/to/relevant/page"
      check_for: "Brief description of what to verify (e.g., API signature, YAML syntax)"
    - url: "https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/path/to/page"
      check_for: "Brief description of what to verify"

# --- Example: Fully populated for a GenAI skill ---
# metadata:
#   author: databricks-sa
#   version: "1.0.0"
#   domain: genai-agents
#   role: worker
#   last_verified: "2026-02-07"
#   volatility: high
#   verification_sources:
#     - url: "https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/serving/responses-agent"
#       check_for: "ResponsesAgent class API, predict() signature, predict_stream() behavior"
#     - url: "https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/create-manage-serving-endpoints.html"
#       check_for: "OBO authentication flow, SystemAuthPolicy format"

# --- Example: Minimal for a stable skill ---
# metadata:
#   author: databricks-sa
#   version: "1.0.0"
#   domain: gold
#   role: worker
#   last_verified: "2026-02-07"
#   volatility: low
#   # No verification_sources needed — patterns are stable and self-contained
