# Skill Navigator (Quick Reference)

**MANDATORY:** Before starting any Databricks implementation task, consult this routing table. For ambiguous tasks, read the full skill navigator: `.cursor/skills/skill-navigator/SKILL.md`

## Design-First Pipeline

```
context/*.csv → Gold Design (1) → Bronze (2) → Silver (3) → Gold Impl (4) → Planning (5) → Semantic (6) → Observability (7) → ML (8) → GenAI (9)
```

**New project?** Start at stage 1: place schema CSV in `context/`, then read `gold/00-gold-layer-design`.

## Orchestrator Routing

## Worker Routing (specific tasks)

| Keywords | Read This Skill |
|----------|-----------------|
| "job failed", "troubleshoot", "deploy failed", "self-heal" | `.cursor/skills/common/databricks-autonomous-operations/SKILL.md` |
| "naming", "COMMENT", "tag", "PII", "snake_case", "budget policy" | `.cursor/skills/common/naming-tagging-standards/SKILL.md` |
| "Asset Bundle", "DAB", "deploy", "job YAML" | `.cursor/skills/common/databricks-asset-bundles/SKILL.md` |
| "import", "sys.path", "restartPython", "notebook module" | `.cursor/skills/common/databricks-python-imports/SKILL.md` |
| "TBLPROPERTIES", "CDF", "auto-optimize", "table properties" | `.cursor/skills/common/databricks-table-properties/SKILL.md` |
| "CREATE SCHEMA", "schema setup", "predictive optimization" | `.cursor/skills/common/schema-management-patterns/SKILL.md` |
| "PRIMARY KEY", "FOREIGN KEY", "constraint", "PK/FK" | `.cursor/skills/common/unity-catalog-constraints/SKILL.md` |
| "audit skills", "check freshness", "stale skills", "verify skills" | `.cursor/skills/admin/skill-freshness-audit/SKILL.md` |

## Key Rule

**Read the orchestrator skill FIRST.** It will tell you which worker skills and common skills to read for each phase.
